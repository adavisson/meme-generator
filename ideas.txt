For Project Meeting
-----------------------
What will your three AJAX calls do?
(You must use at least two of the four CRUD actions - create, read, update, delete. And you must utilize the fetch API. You may have more than 3 AJAX calls, but 3 is the minimum.)
1st AJAX call:  Fetch phrases
2nd AJAX call:  Create phrases
3rd AJAX call:  Fetch Memes

How will you include a resource with at least one has_many relationship via JavaScript & JSON?

What is meant by JavaScript Model Objects and how will you implement them in your application?
- Would have meme objects so that the program can have more condensed and specialized functions/methods


Questions
-----------
How would you used JS classes with Ruby models? Do you duplicate them?

Notes
------
- Should end all promise chains with a catch
- What is better practice: promise chain or async/await functions
- var gets hoisted
- let does not get hoisted
